Brief Description: An MUN is a replica model of the official UN in which volunteers roleplay delegates of various countries registered in the UN(193 countries).
Every MUN has a set of committees and the agendas(or topics) are segregated into these committees. In every MUN, a volunteer is provided with a committee and its agenda.
The MUN session is a form of a uniform debate in which countries debate on a topic and reach to a peaceful solution. This is done at the very end of the MUN session when 
Delegates of several countries propose resolutions and those resolutions are voted upon by the delegates of all countries. On the basis of the majority of votes,
a certain resolution is passed. MUN sessions can last for 1-3 days usually. But its all upto the voting procedures to continue an MUN or put an end to it.
